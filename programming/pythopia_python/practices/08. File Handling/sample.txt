    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes clear syntax and reduces the need for complex boilerplate code, making it popular among both beginners and experienced developers.

    One of Pythonâ€™s strengths is its versatility: it can be used for web development, data science, machine learning, automation, scientific computing, and more. Its large standard library and active community provide countless packages and frameworks that extend its capabilities, such as NumPy for numerical computing, Django for web development, and TensorFlow for machine learning.

    Because of its ease of use and wide range of applications, Python has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world today.
